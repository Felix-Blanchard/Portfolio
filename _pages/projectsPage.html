        Game Review Website API
    </div>

    <p>Developed for SENG365. I built a backend API for a game review website that lets users submit and manage reviews. I tested the API using Bruno.</p>

        Microcontroller Memory Game
    </div>

    <p>Developed for ENCE260. My partner and I programmed a microcontroller in C to create a basic memory game. The game used two microcontrollers communicating with IR and serial communication. Modularising the code with header files was a big focus.</p>

        Wine Wise
    </div>

    <p>Developed for SENG202. I worked with a team of five to build a wine review and recommendation app using JavaFX. One of my major areas of learning was multithreading, where I created a loading screen to avoid overloading the JavaFX thread when interacting with large datasets in the database. One of the notable learning aresas from the app was popups. We relied on them too heavily and used them in place of proper pages resulting in  it being very hard to add new functionality and also forced us to keep  loading screens very basic.</p>

        RipV2 Routing Daemon
    </div>

    <p>Currently developing for COSC364. My partner and I are creating a basic RIPv2 routing daemon using socket programming and UDP sockets. With a fairly limited scope, it was up to us to implement our own error checking and terminal outputs.</p>

        Renovation Tracker Web App
    </div>

    <p>Currently developing for SENG302. I work as a full stack developer in a team of 7 to build a renovations app. We use Spring Boot along with various APIs and libraries. This project is the outcome of a year-long software engineering course at the University of Canterbury. We work with agile development practices including scrum meetings and different testing approaches like integration, cucumber and unit testing. The project uses Spring Boot for backend, Thymeleaf for templating and Bootstrap for styling.</p>
