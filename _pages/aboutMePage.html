    Hi I’m Felix. I am an aspiring software engineer currently studying in my third year at the university of canterbury. I have a passion for creating innovative solutions and collaborating effectively with a team. I enjoy environments where I can tackle problems creatively and continuously learn.

    Outside of coding, I love spending time outdoors, hanging out with friends and family, and discovering new music. I enjoy listening to albums across all genres.
</p>

<p>
    I enjoy learning new coding languages and tools to expand my knowledge. I am currently learning C++ in my spare time. I also enjoy challenging myself with problems on Project Euler to sharpen my coding and critical thinking skills. Additionally, I am interested in the evolving role of AI in the future, and regular keep up to date by listening to tech podcasts like Hard Fork.

    I'm actively seeking software internship opportunities for the summer, where I can apply skills and gain valuable industry insights. Feel free to reach out if you’re interested! My CV is attached in the footer.
