<p>
    Hi I’m Felix. I am an aspiring software engineer currently studying in my third year at the University of Canterbury. I have a passion for creating innovative solutions and collaborating effectively with a team. I enjoy environments where I can tackle problems creatively and continuously learn.
</p>

<p>
    Outside of coding, I love spending time outdoors, hanging out with friends and family, and discovering new music. I enjoy listening to albums across all genres.
</p>

<p>
    I enjoy learning new coding languages and tools to expand my knowledge. I am currently learning C++ in my spare time. I also enjoy challenging myself with problems on Project Euler to sharpen my coding and critical thinking skills. Additionally, I am interested in the evolving role of AI in the future and regularly keep up to date by listening to tech podcasts like <em>Hard Fork</em>.
</p>

<p>
    I'm actively seeking software internship opportunities for the summer, where I can apply skills and gain valuable industry insights. Feel free to reach out if you’re interested! My CV is attached in the footer.
